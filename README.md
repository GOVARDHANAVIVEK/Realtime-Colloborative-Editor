# Realtime Collaborative Editor

A real-time collaborative code editor built with React, Socket.IO, and the Monaco Editor.  This project enables multiple users to simultaneously edit a shared document, providing a seamless collaborative coding experience.

## Features

* **Real-time Collaboration:** Multiple users can edit the same document concurrently, with changes instantly synchronized across all clients.
* **Cursor Tracking:**  See the real-time cursor positions of other collaborators, enhancing awareness and coordination.
* **Syntax Highlighting:**  Leverages the Monaco Editor for rich syntax highlighting for a variety of programming languages.
* **User Color Identification:** Each user is assigned a distinct color for their cursor and highlights, making it easy to track individual contributions.
* **Temporary Highlights:** Newly typed text is temporarily highlighted to visually emphasize recent changes.
* **Clean and Efficient Code:**  The codebase is designed for maintainability and optimal performance.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** React
* **Backend:** Node.js (with Socket.IO)
* **Editor:** Monaco Editor
* **Communication:** Socket.IO
